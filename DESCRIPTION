Description: Computational methods allow the extraction of mechanistic signatures
    from omics data based on prior knowledge resources, reducing the dimensionality 
    of the data for increased statistical power and better interpretability. 
    Here, we present decoupleR, a Bioconductor package containing different 
    statistical methods to extract these signatures within a unified framework. 
    decoupleR allows the user to flexibly test any method with any resource. 
    It incorporates methods that take into account the sign and weight of 
    network interactions. Using decoupleR, we evaluated the performance of 
    contemporary methods on transcriptomic and phospho-proteomic perturbation 
    experiments.
