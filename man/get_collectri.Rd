\alias{get_collectri}
\title{CollecTRI gene regulatory network.
Wrapper to access CollecTRI gene regulatory network. CollecTRI is a
comprehensive resource containing a curated collection of transcription
factors (TFs) and their target genes. It is an expansion of DoRothEA.
Each interaction is weighted by its mode of regulation (either positive or negative).}
\usage{
get_collectri(
  organism = "human",
  split_complexes = FALSE,
  load_meta = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{organism}{Which organism to use. Only human, mouse and rat are available.}

\item{split_complexes}{Whether to split complexes into subunits. By default
complexes are kept as they are.}

\item{load_meta}{Whether to load meta data for the TF-gene interactions. This is set
to false by default.}

\item{...}{Optional additional arguments, passed to OmniPath import_transcriptional_interactions.}
